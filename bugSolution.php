The solution is to always use the strict comparison operator (`===`) when you need to ensure both the value and the type match:

```php
$stringZero = '0';
$integerZero = 0;

if ($stringZero === $integerZero) {
    echo "They are equal (strict comparison)\n"; // This will NOT execute
}

if ($stringZero == $integerZero) {
    echo "They are equal (loose comparison)\n"; // This will execute
}

//Best Practice:  Always use strict comparison when type matters

if ($stringZero === '0'){
  echo "They are strictly equal (string)\n"; //This will execute
}
```
By using strict comparison (`===`), you ensure that both the type and value are identical before the comparison evaluates to true, preventing unexpected results due to PHP's type juggling behavior.
